**Pros and Cons of TDD**

TDD is a method of software development which has many benefits: Only writing code that is necessary (code that passes all required tests), ease of maintenance, and keeps the code well-documented as the tests themselves document the code. The code also becomes very easy to test and debug as all functions are tested within thei rown test functions. However, the ease of maintenance and prevention of unnecessary code has its own drawbacks. Tests have to be updated alongside the code it is responsible for, which takes additional time despite the added ease of maintenance. It is also possible for coders to over-complicate tests or write subpar tests due to human error, although this is moreso due to not following TDD practices.
